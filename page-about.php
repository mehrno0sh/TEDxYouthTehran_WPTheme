                <p>TEDxYouth@Tehran is part of the TEDxYouth initiative by TED. On and around the time of Universal
                    Children’s Day, several cities and communities host a TEDxYouth event. While each event is different
                    in format, size and theme, they have a shared vision: inspiring creativity, igniting innovation, and
                    empowering the youth. TEDxYouth@Tehran is based on a central premise that every young person is the
                    captain of their destiny, the master of their life. They need to take responsibility for their life,
                    be independent thinkers and explore their imagination. They need to feel empowered and bold to do
                    game-changing innovations, technologies and businesses. We design our event theme and invite
                    speakers to give the youth a sense of hope, examples of role models, ideas to innovate and create,
                    and to reach their full potential</p>
